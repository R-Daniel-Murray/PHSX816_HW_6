Homework 6

This is Homework 6. I am still trying to figure out how to implement the Gaussian Quadrature. The Newton-Coates approximation can be run with Newton_Coates.py. It provides the 
numerical integration of 3x^{4}+4x^{3} -25x^{2} +120x +1  between -5 and +5 using steps of 0.01. The answer it provides is 1676.4992083541683 compared to the actual answer of 1676.66666666666 repeating
